## PyGeodesy

A pure Python implementation of geodesy tools for various ellipsoidal
and spherical earth models using trigonometric and vector-based methods
for geodetic (lat-/longitude) and geocentric cartesian (x/y/z) coordinates.

Transcribed from JavaScript originals by _(C) Chris Veness 2005-2016_
and published under the same MIT Licence*.

There are two modules for ellipsoidal earth models, _ellipsoidalVincenty_
and _-Nvector_ and two for spherical ones, _sphericalTrigonometry_ and
_-Nvector_.  Each module provides a _LatLon_ class with methods to compute
distance, initial and final bearing, intermediate points and conversions,
among other things.  For more information and further details see the
documentation* and some of the original descriptions:

- <http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-vincenty.html>
- <http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-vectors.html>

Also included are conversions to and from UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)
coordinates, MGRS (NATO Military Grid Reference System) and OSGR (British
Ordinance Survery Grid Reference) grid references, see:

- <http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-os-gridref.html>

and a module for Geohash encoding and decoding, transcribed from:

An additional module provides Lambert conformal conic projections
and positions, transcribed from:

Another module offers functions to simplify or linearize a path of
_LatLon_ points, including implementations of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker
and Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithms and modified versions of both:

All Python code has been statically checked* with PyChecker, PyFlakes,
PyCodeStyle (formerly Pep8), McCabe on Python 2.7.10 and 2.7.13
and with Flake8 on Python 3.6.0.  The tests were run with 64-bit
Python 2.6.9, 2.7.10, 2.7.13, 3.5.2, 3.5.3 and 3.6.0, but only on
MacOSX 10.10 Yosemite, MacOSX 10.11 El Capitan and/or macOS 10.12.2,
10.12.3 and 10.12.4 Sierra.

In addition to the Python code, the ```zip``` and ```tar``` distribution
files contain test cases, test results and the entire documentation*
generated by Epydoc.  Some function and method names differ from the
JavaScript version.  In such cases documentation tag ```JS name:``` shows
the original JavaScript name.
